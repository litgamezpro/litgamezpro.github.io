<h2>How to Play Sliding Blocks</h2><br />
<br />
<h3>To begin any sliding block strategy, you should know what you are trying to accomplish.</h3><br />
<br />
<p>In most sliding block games, you start with a grid filled with pieces, one empty space, and you have to slide pieces into the empty space in order to move blocks. Your goal is either to complete a picture, move a specific block to a destination location, or line numbers in order.</p><br />
<br />
<h3>Here is a brief guide to help you play sliding puzzle free versions, or any sliding blocks games.</h3><br />
<br />
<p><strong>Look at the end goal.</strong> Before you start moving pieces on the board, look to see what the puzzle is asking for. Are you assembling an image, or trying to move a special block out of the grids of the puzzle?</p><br />
<br />
<p><strong>Plan your moves.</strong> Don't just slide random pieces on a whim. Thinking ahead is part of the strategy for sliding puzzles. Many online sliding puzzle games keep track of the count of the pieces you've moved, so the lower the number of moves you use, the better your score.</p><br />
<br />
<p><strong>Work from the outside towards the middle.</strong> A successful strategy for most sliding block puzzles is to begin by arranging blocks at the edges and corners first, and when you have arranged blocks along the edges, you can analyze the remaining blocks and arrange them.</p><br />
<br />
<p><strong>Keep your cool.</strong> It is easy to get frustrated because the pieces you want to organize are not cooperating. So take a break.</p><br />
